# pymultikdf
This python module provides wrappers for C functions implementing the
following Key Derivation Functions (KDF)s:
  - PBKDF2
  - bcrypt
  - scrypt

## What is a Key Derivation Function?
From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function):

In cryptography, a key derivation function (or KDF) derives one or more secret keys from a secret value such as a master key, a password, or a passphrase using a pseudo-random function.[1][2] KDFs can be used to stretch keys into longer keys or to obtain keys of a required format, such as converting a group element that is the result of a Diffie–Hellman key exchange into a symmetric key for use with AES. Keyed cryptographic hash functions are popular examples of pseudo-random functions used for key derivation.

### What is PBKDF2?
PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a key derivation function that is part of RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series, specifically PKCS #5 v2.0, also published as Internet Engineering Task Force's RFC 2898. It replaces an earlier standard, PBKDF1, which could only produce derived keys up to 160 bits long.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2

### What is bcrypt?
bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords designed by Niels Provos and David Mazières, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 1999.[1] Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for BSD and other systems including some Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux.[2] The prefix "$2a$" or "$2b$" (or "$2y$") in a hash string in a shadow password file indicates that hash string is a bcrypt hash in modular crypt format.[3] The rest of the hash string includes the cost parameter, a 128-bit salt (base-64 encoded as 22 characters), and 184 bits of the resulting hash value (base-64 encoded as 31 characters).[4] The cost parameter specifies a key expansion iteration count as a power of two, which is an input to the crypt algorithm.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt

### What is scrypt?
In cryptography, scrypt is a password-based key derivation function created by Colin Percival, originally for the Tarsnap online backup service.[1] The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. In 2012, the scrypt algorithm was published by IETF as an Internet Draft, intended to become an informational RFC.[2]

# Relationship to existing packages
Existing python packages for PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt
  - pip install fastpbkdf2
  - pip install bcrypt
  - pip install scrypt

## Why a new module?
Sometimes one wants to try or use MULTIPLE different Key Derivation Functions.  In such cases, instead of installing MULTIPLE SEPARATE python, packages, just this single module can be installed and used.

This may also be a convenience when porting your code to run under 'Python For Android (https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android)

## Are there any differences?
Exactly and ONLY the following C functions have been wrapped

From fastpbkdf2:

    fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha1
    fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha256
    fastpbkdf2_hmac_sha512

From bcrypt:

    bcrypt_kdf

From scrypt:

    crypto_scrypt

The following methods should be exactly equivalent to the corresponding methods in the existing python wrappers:

        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        Module.method                       Identical to
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        multikdf.fastpbkdf2.pbkdf2_hmac     fastpbkdf2.pbkdf2_hmac
        multikdf.bcrypt.kdf                 bcrypt.kdf
        multikdf.scrypt.hash                scrypt.hash
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
